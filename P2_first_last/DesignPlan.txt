After reading the specs, start populating
a list of things you think you might have to
do to finish this project.

1) read the specs - understand the problem
2) Understand map-based input files
3) Create test case maps to test out using the program
4) Create Singly Linked List for Queues
5) Create inputs and outputs and a readMap class so the class can know
   what kind of level user is on
6) Report the runtime
7) Create a 3D array
